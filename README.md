# Hangman
This is a simple implementation of hangman game like a Python project.
There are few steps that I passed through:
1. [Research](#research)
1. [Draft project](#draft_project)
1. [Demo](#demo)
1. [Full implementation](#full_implementation)
1. [Test](#test)
1. [Full documentation](#full_documentation)

## Research
- Analyzing what exactly is the problem and how can I resolve it ?
- What kind of algorithms can I use and how to structure the code ?

## Draft_project
- Making short project specification
- UML diagram

## Demo
- Realising a demo version with basic functionality to check only is it work and is this the right way

## Full_implementation
- Implementing to full project step by step

## Test
- Making some tests of code functionality
- In this state just manual

## Full_documentation
- Writing the full documentation of the project
